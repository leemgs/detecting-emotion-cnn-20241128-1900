### Introduction

This project leverages the CK+ dataset and a CNN model implemented in MATLAB to classify emotions into one of seven categories. The final model is capable of processing real-time images from a live camera feed to detect emotions.

### Workflow Overview

1. **Download Dataset**: Use the CK+ dataset available on Kaggle.
2. **Preprocessing**: Images are loaded into an `imageDatastore` for easy manipulation and split into training and validation sets.
3. **CNN Architecture**: A custom CNN is defined with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers.
4. **Training**: The model is trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (SGDM) optimizer.
5. **Validation**: Accuracy and confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model's performance.
6. **Live Camera Integration**: The trained model is deployed to classify emotions from live webcam input.

### Requirements

1. MATLAB with the following toolboxes:
   - Deep Learning Toolbox
   - Computer Vision Toolbox
2. CK+ dataset from Kaggle:
   - [CK+ Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shawon10/ckplus)
3. Webcam or IP Camera for real-time testing.

### Steps to Run

1. **Download and Set Up Dataset**:
   - Download the CK+ dataset from Kaggle and extract it to a folder named `CK+48`.

2. **Load Images**:
   - Update the `folderPath` variable in the MATLAB script with the correct path to the dataset.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Run the script to preprocess the data and train the CNN.

4. **Validate the Model**:
   - Check the accuracy and confusion matrix using the validation dataset.

5. **Real-Time Detection**:
   - Use a connected webcam or IP camera for real-time emotion detection.

### Key Sections

#### 1. **Dataset Preparation**
- **Script**:
  ```matlab
  folderPath = 'CK+48';
  imds = imageDatastore(folderPath, 'IncludeSubfolders', true, 'LabelSource', 'foldernames');
  [imdstrain, imdsvalid] = splitEachLabel(imds, 0.8, 'randomize');
  ```

- The dataset is divided into training (80%) and validation (20%) subsets.

#### 2. **CNN Architecture**
- **Key Features**:
  - Input layer for 48x48 grayscale images.
  - Three convolutional layers with ReLU activation and max pooling.
  - Fully connected layer with seven output units for emotion classes.

- **Script**:
  ```matlab
  layers = [
      imageInputLayer([48 48 1])
      convolution2dLayer(3, 8, 'Padding', 'same')
      batchNormalizationLayer
      reluLayer
      maxPooling2dLayer(2, 'Stride', 2)
      ...
      fullyConnectedLayer(7)
      softmaxLayer
      classificationLayer];
  ```

#### 3. **Training the Model**
- **Options**:
  - Learning rate: 0.01
  - Maximum epochs: 10

- **Script**:
  ```matlab
  options = trainingOptions('sgdm', ...
      'InitialLearnRate', 0.01, ...
      'MaxEpochs', 10, ...
      'Shuffle', 'every-epoch', ...
      'ValidationFrequency', 10, ...
      'Verbose', false, ...
      'Plots', 'training-progress');
  convnet = trainNetwork(imdstrain, layers, options);
  ```

#### 4. **Validation**
- Evaluate the model with accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix:
  ```matlab
  YPred = classify(convnet, imdsvalid);
  YValidation = imdsvalid.Labels;
  accuracy = sum(YPred == YValidation) / numel(YValidation);
  plotconfusion(YValidation, YPred);
  ```

### Live Camera Integration

The trained model is used for real-time emotion detection using a webcam or IP camera.

- **Webcam Example**:
  ```matlab
  camera = webcam(1);
  while true
      im = camera.snapshot;
      picture = rgb2gray(im);
      picture = imresize(picture, [48, 48]);
      label = classify(convnet, picture);
      image(im);
      title(char(label));
      drawnow;
  end
  ```

- **IP Camera Example**:
  ```matlab
  camera = ipcam('http://192.168.225.88:8080/video');
  ```

### Output

1. **Accuracy**: Displays the classification accuracy for the validation dataset.
2. **Confusion Matrix**: Provides a visual representation of model performance.
3. **Real-Time Predictions**: Displays live webcam feed with detected emotion as the title.
